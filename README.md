# hamrgb

Generate pretty images with all RGB colors.

The images are generated by forming a hamiltonian cycle through the pixel locations of the canvas, and another hamiltonian cycle through the RGB locations of the color cube. These cycles are walked simultaneously to produce an extraordinarily "smooth" output image.
